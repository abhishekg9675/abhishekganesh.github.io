Amidst the chaos, there lies a trail which leads us out of the present
into uncharted territories. The trail doesn't hold the promise of an
absolutely rewarding life. But as they say, the journey matters more
than the destination. Following the path as a lone warrior takes
unwavering courage and determination. Facing obstacles, solving problems
and moving ahead toughens you up to the core and helps you deal with
whatever life throws at you. Failure is just a phase that everyone
passes through at some point in their life. These act as pivot points
and change the path we follow considering what we learn from it. We are
molded by the decisions we take and the environment we live in. Life is
as beautiful and interesting as you want it to be. Everyone has
problems, in the end the only thing that matters is you shape your life
by choosing the problems you love to solve.
