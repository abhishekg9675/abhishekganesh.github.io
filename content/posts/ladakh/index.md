# Do humans need to change?

Did life really begin in water? Whatever theory we have known or yet
studied, details the growth and evolution of life from rudimentary
single celled organisms to the most complex machine on the planet: The
Human Species.

No theory ever was taught regarding from where this single celled
organism came from. Considering various religious beliefs, did God play
a part in this? Or was that cell transported from an alien planet
through meteors?
Else was it pure chemistry that made life possible on earth- complex
reactions of gases like oxygen, nitrogen, etc. with the water cycle,
volcanic eruptions, lightning strikes occurring every now and then,
combined all together over a large period of time, forming biomolecules
like amino acids, complex sugars, etc. which are the basic constituents
of the DNA, the crucial ingredient for life.
If "this" turns out to be true, all religious theories would instantly
fade away which describe, God to have made life possible on earth.
Religious beliefs have been created by us, humans to explain things
which we yet do not understand. This means we have to search for answers
beyond our realm of understanding and modify our beliefs accordingly.
Science must be the one true religion. We humans are the most advanced
species living on this planet. The only thing that makes us so, is the
ability to pass on information to further generations. Our ancestors did
not have the tools and knowledge to probe into such areas. But, we today
with a strength of over 6.5 billion people with access to nearly all the
information through the medium of internet.
Yet instead we discuss concepts like the origin of humans through a
couple, who supposedly populated this entire planet. There are killings
and sacrifices in the name of God.
This needs to change now, and each individual must be responsible for
this change. Saying 'Education' is the solution is only partially
correct.
An open minded view with a will to explore & unravel the truths of the
world must be inculcated at an early age.
This and only this will determine where we as a human race will reach in
the future and will all these efforts be of any value.
