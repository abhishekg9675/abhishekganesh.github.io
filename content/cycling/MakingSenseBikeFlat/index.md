A hundred kilometres away from the city, down the lonely roads of an old
village, as remote as it can get, facing a dam with water creeping by,
here we stand isolated from the hustle and bustle, fixing a flat!

Cycling has taught me a lot of things, but the most important of all to
be self reliant and sticking together! Riding such long distances into
remote corners, there's no guarantee of finding a cycle repair shop
within a walking distance (or should I say driving distance?). You might
need to ride/walk more than 10--20 kilometres just on the hope of
finding a repair shop which might not even be listed on google maps :(.
And consider your hope to be definitely crushed if its after 8pm.
Carrying a basic toolkit, puncture kit, some snacks and water is almost
indispensable.

Life too works as such! There's always an insurmountable force which
prevents you to reach your intended destination. You'll be all alone
cursing yourself for being that situation. It is always good to be
prepared, but you cannot have your shields up all the time. That's the
point where you learn acceptance, humility and the courage to get going.
The journey is what gives you the most pleasure and satisfaction, not
the destination. You'll always remember the physical and mental barrier
you overcame to reach where you are! Give yourself kudos to breaking
those walls and going through the journey of life :)

There are infinite flat tyres you'll need to fix, so buckle up! There's
a joy to be found and cherished in fixing things too.

P.S. My hub bearing broke down a few hours after this! And the ride got
extended by 6 hours :(
