# Traversing Switzerland

Absolute banger!

We started from the far east of Switzerland, right on the border with Austria. The road took us through the Engadin valley and up the Flüela Pass. It was the first big climb, and we still felt fresh, so it went okay.

Then came the Oberalppass. Almost 40 km of climbing. It was long, slow, and tough. Reaching the top felt like a small victory. The reward? A beautiful, chilly descent into Andermatt.

That’s where we met Julia, the amazing bartender. She gave me a spare t-shirt for the freezing ride ahead and even some free (mandatory) vodka shots to lift our spirits. I swear it was the vodka that got me up the Susten Pass at 2 a.m., under a sky full of stars. No moon, no clouds, just the Milky Way shining above us. It was unreal.

The descent led us to a quiet train station, where we grabbed 1.5 hours of sleep. Not much, but better than nothing. Morning came in cold and heavy tired eyes, empty stomachs, but we kept going. Reached Spiez for a proper breakfast, which helped a lot.

Then came Jaunpass. It was hot, exposed, and so much harder than expected. Our legs already had 350 km and 6000 m of climbing in them, and it really started to hurt. We made it to Bulle, then Lausanne, climbing more hills that didn’t even show up clearly on the route profile as they were overshadowed by the mighty mountain passes over the swiss alps.

Then, finally, we saw road signs for Geneva. That moment felt so good. Maybe even the best sign we saw! We were almost there. Just had to push through the city traffic and keep going till the French border.

At last, we reached it. The very end of Switzerland, in the middle of a quiet forest. The sky was glowing pink as the sun set behind the Jura mountains. Our bike computers crossed 500 km. We rolled to a stop, about 5 meters from the border.

We were tired, happy, and proud.

Overall an amazing ride which shall be remembered for ages!
