Twin Hills 600 BRM Bangalore Randonneurs
First Posted on Strava: https://www.strava.com/activities/4981881977/

## The Beginning

It all began on a Sunday ride with my friends Madhav, Roy and Priyanka to Bettamugilalam. It was a hefty climb nearby Anchetty. This was the first time I heard the name "Twin Hills". I hadn't even completed my first brevet yet. So naturally, a 600-kilometre ride, scaling 2 hills and the Krishnagiri climb on the way back seemed too intimidating for me. Or should I say scared!

The following week, I read a couple of blogs written by Monish and Chetan about their experiences on the Twin Hills brevet. A cold shiver ran down my spine just by reading those blogs. I completed my first 200 BRM the very next week and 300, 400 BRMs in the following months. The day I came to know the next 600 BRM is going to be the "Twin Hills", I felt a little disappointed as I knew it would be a damn difficult 600 for me to complete. And furthermore, I had to complete a 600BRM for achieving the SR title. The next 600 after this would be in July which is more than 4 months from now. I thought to myself and decided to attempt the brevet and try to at least climb the two hills rather than complete the entire distance in 40 hrs. It would definitely be one hell of an experience.

## The Day of the Brevet

The day of the brevet. All packed and ready, took a couple of bar of snickers, 4/5 packets of coffee decoction, and some electrolytes for the day 2 sunny ride. Reached the start point by 5:40 pm, completed the necessary formalities and stood in the line for the clock to hit 06:00 pm.

Met Naga Prakash and Manju who were going to be my ride companions for the next 40 hours. I had ridden with them during my last 400BRM along with Sridhar who was supposed to join us but was running late. I and Naga decided to start the ride and wait for him at the Attibele toll. It was 06:00 pm and off we go!

## Through Bangalore Traffic to Krishnagiri

Heavy traffic greeted us at every signal and narrow roads till Electronic city. My everyday commute crossing Silkboard in heavy traffic proved to be quite helpful and I passed on the traffic easily. I reached Attibele, took a short break had some coconut water and tried calling Naga but couldn't connect. I then started to head towards Krishnagiri and decided to take a long break at the dinner point and meet up with Naga there.

Nearby Hosur I caught up with Santosh who was quite a strong rider. During the ride, he casually mentioned he has done this same route twice or thrice before and warned about the sun and the headwinds we need to face the next day. Definitely helped me prepare myself for what lays ahead :) I was struggling to keep up with him. He had given me company till the dinner point at Krishnagiri.

It was 10 pm, 95 kilometres done! Santosh had finished his meal quickly and started his ride towards Salem. I had decided to wait for Naga and then ride together from here on forward. Soon Naga arrived and told Sridhar had met with some accident near Attibele toll and quit the brevet. I felt quite bad as we were like the three musketeers during the last 400 brevet. Nevertheless, we kept our hopes up, had a fulfilling meal and started our ride.

## The Descent to Yercaud Base

It was all downhill till Salem so we decided to maintain a good pace and reach Yercaud base as early as possible. We took a couple of coffee, snacks and water breaks in between and reached the Thoppur ghat. The descent experience was something completely different. There were infinite reflectors on both sides of the road, speakers shouting to go slow (which definitely didn't apply to us) we sped down the descent at the highest gear. The only problem of having the same route on the way back is, we had to climb all this while returning.

We soon reached the Yercaud base where a support station was set up at a petrol pump. We took a short 5 min nap, freshened up, had some food and were all set for the mighty climb which lied ahead.

## Conquering Yercaud

We started the climb at around 4:30 am. It was pitch dark and I started to feel a lot tired and sleepy. After around 25--30% of the climb. I parked my cycle beside a wall and slept for some good 15--20 mins on the sidewall. I woke up and was good to go. Met a few riders climbing the hairpins. I still remember the moment where I was tackling the 10th hairpin bend, a cyclist swooped passed me on the descent. He might be in the top lead position of all the riders. A couple of more riders passed by while I was climbing the hill.

The temperature definitely dropped significantly and I started to feel cold. I met Shyam and Kishor while we were almost at the top of the climb. The Top of the climb was the CP2 where we had to take a selfie. It was 7:30 am, it took me almost 3 hours to tackle the climb. Afterwards, we had stopped for a short coffee break where Naga and Manju had joined. The hot coffee with some biscuits at top of the hill in chill weather felt like blissful heaven to be in. It was 8 am and 228 km done. Felt pretty good as one of the hills was conquered!

## Salem and the Strava Incident

The descent was pretty quick and we had stopped for breakfast at Salem. I started browsing through my phone, and when I opened strava, I realised it did not record my Yercaud climb. I was pissed off as it meant I have to attempt the climb again some other day to record it on strava. It would have been my biggest climb to date; 1034 mts. This also meant my total ride distance on Strava won't tally up to 600 km. Shook it off, and moved on!

## The Scorching Afternoon Sun

The most difficult section starts now. Riding in the hot afternoon sun. There was a control point 3 planned just after the Thoppur ghat. The sun was treacherous. It drained all my energy within the first hour itself. Had to take multiple breaks and fueled up with coconut water, watermelon, orange juices and plenty of other hydrants. I had caught up with a group of 3 riders (forgot their names) who were riding at a good pace which I was able to maintain. We were drafting one behind the other which helped a lot. After a while, I started to fall back and had to take another break.

Naga caught up to me and now was the time to tackle the thoppur ghat climb. As soon as I started the climb, within a few hundred metres, my skin started to burn due to the intense heat and the steep climb. I had to take out my bottle and pour water all over my head and jersey to cool myself down. I met Gnaneshwar and another rider halfway on the climb and we took a break for some refreshing coconut water. It helped me a lot. We all along with Naga started tackling the next portion of the climb and soon reached the CP3. It was 12:38 pm, 307 km done.

## The Lunch Crisis

Big mistake: We skipped having lunch at the restaurant at the CP as we assumed only biriyani to be available. I and Naga planned to ride ahead and have a good meal at some other restaurant. To our dismay, no restaurants could be found. we were riding on the Salem-Krishnagiri highway in peak afternoon. There was literally no shade to take rest under. Feeling restless, I had to park my road in the middle of the road and sat down.

I got a call from Naga who was a couple of hundred metres ahead of me (I still could see him) and asked me if something's wrong. I told him I was too tired and I need to have some food. I checked google maps, and there were absolutely no restaurants for the next 8--10 km. I was pretty sure I was going to quit there, catch some truck and go home. Then Naga said, there is a small local hotel where he was waiting and we can have food there. The hotel proved to be a lifesaver. I would have definitely quit if I wouldn't have had my lunch there. A big bowl of curd rice, sambhar, potato curry and Vada. A fulfilling meal yet again. After the meal, I slept for a good 20 mins and I was back to normal, full of energy.

## Push Towards Yelagiri

We both started to ride towards Krishnagiri. Again, the scorching heat slowed us down. Multiple hydration breaks kept us cool. We got separated for a while at that stretch. I had taken a halt at a watermelon stall where I met Shyam whom I had met during the end of the Yercaud climb. He seemed quite tired and decided to take some rest and nearby petrol pump. I too finished my watermelon and took a washroom break at the petrol pump. I then started to ride ahead where I met Naga on the approach to Krishnagiri (some 5kms). Took a short coffee break along with some biscuits and wafers and started to proceed towards Yelagiri.

It was 4:30 pm (I guess) and 365kms done. The next CP was at 391km. We met Dhananjay sir at the intersection who guided us towards the route. We were exhausted and were not able to maintain the pace. The headwinds on this section added to the exhaustion. While nearing the CP, I was looking at the kilometre count on my Strava every 5 minutes and kept asking Naga where was the CP (Sorry :( for that btw). We reached the CP4 by 7:08 pm, 391 km done(The closing time was at 8 pm). We knew we were running very late.

## The Yelagiri Challenge

The next CP was at the top of Yelagiri at 437.5 km. We both were quite tired and decided to have dinner. We soon stopped at a nearby Dhaba and had roti and sabzi. I couldn't eat much, but sufficient enough to sustain until the next CP. A lot of riders met at the Dhabha, Manju joined along from here. A lot of riders who attempted the climb a week before were saying the climb would be easier and it would take around 2 hours to climb. I had climbed Mullayanagiri in Chikmagalur a few months back, which was almost similar in distance and elevation. It took me more than an hour to finish that climb. And we had started riding from the base rather than from a distance. Before the Yelagiri climb starts, we would have had more than 425 km in our legs. So it was pretty safe to assume, it would take 2 hours for the climb.

It was around 8 pm, 50kms left to the CP which closes at 11:10 pm. We started riding towards the Vaniyambadi toll, took a short break to refill our bottles, bought some cakes for us to fuel up during the climb. It was almost 9 pm, we just took the right to approach Yelagiri base from the toll plaza. It was some 6 more kilometers to the base. Considering, 2 hours for the climb we were running pretty damn late. We thought to pace ourselves now. A huge obstacle lied ahead of us now, which we realized too late. The 6 kilometer stretch till the base was too patchy and broken roads. We were not able to maintain even a speed of 15 km/hr. Trucks and busses were driving at crazy speeds and kept constantly pushing us down the road. It took us more than 1/2 hour to reach the Yelagiri base.

It was 9:40 pm, 425 km done. My longest ride yet was 400 km, which was during last month (February). I figured the next 200 would definitely be challenging. The CP closes by 11:10 pm, which meant 1 hour 30 minutes to complete the climb. We took a short break at the base, had some cakes, I kept half of it in my jersey pockets had enough water and started the climb. I promised myself to give all it takes on the 11km climb section (600m+ elevation gain). I thought to myself, I'll try to complete the climb within the time limit, as completing the brevet seemed very far-fetched to me now with extreme time constraints and the Krishnagiri climb which lies ahead.

I opened my jersey zipper a little bit (The trick I learned from Madhav's experience on Bhadra 600), rolled up my arm sleeves, started a heavy breathing pattern and started pushing the pedals. I took a single break for water halfway for hardly a minute and then reached the top in a time of 1 hour. I met a lot of riders on the way up, so I waited for them so that we could have each other's company on the way back. CP4, 10:40pm, 437.5 km done. Some delicious curd rice and a hell of lot of snacks were waiting for us. Soon, Naga, Manju, and everyone else joined in. We took a short 20 min nap and then proceeded to complete the brevet.

## The Battle Against Sleep

I and Naga were damn sleepy. We each tore a packet of coffee decoction and drank it. It was a hell lot bitter than I imagined. It definitely helped, but only for 10--25 minutes. We were back to square one. I was totally unable to concentrate on the road and drive. We both had to take a break at a nearby petrol pump, kept an alarm for 15 minutes and slept. This power nap helped a lot to push another 1/2 hour or so. But still didn't help. Another coffee packets each down our mouths. Worked for a couple of minutes and then sleep kicked back in.

Neither of us were in any condition to ride, 2 days of sleep deprivation kicked in. And from behind comes Manju, who doesn't even look she needs sleep or even a bit tired. We all knew that another break meant we definitely are not going to finish the brevet in time. But, I was definitely not in a condition to ride any more. I NEEDED TO SLEEP. I and Naga stopped at a small tea store, Parked our bikes and decided to sleep for 15 minutes and then start riding. We would definitely need breaks on the Krishnagiri --- Hosur segment (400 BRM experience). Naga had told me to put on an alarm so that we can wake up. As soon as I lied down on the stone bench I slept like a baby. It hardly took seconds for me to sleep (Obviously forgot the alarm).

Suddenly I dreamt something in my sleep, I rolled over and fell on top of the cycle skinning my right knee and minor scratches on my left calf. I took my phone out and checked out the time, it was 3:30 am. We had slept for a whopping 1.5 hours. we still had around 135 km to go with 6.5 hours left. And to top it all off, the Krishnagiri climb was remaining. With more than 450km in our legs, I definitely couldn't see myself maintaining an average of over 20 km/hr over the climbs. We instantly started riding as soon as we woke up.

## The Final Push

I was completely disoriented. I didn't know where I'm riding towards and what I and doing this far from home. It took me a good 15--20 mins to get my mind back into senses and the reality kicked in. We were not going to finish the brevet in time. My knee started to burn a lot. Constant pedalling was definitely not helping my already bruised knee. But I ignored it and kept moving forward. I couldn't stop and stand on the ground as it was hurting a lot as soon as I sat back on the saddle to pedal.

My sleep went off almost completely, I regained my pace, looked at my watch and started to plan for the next section of the route. I was almost at Krishnagiri which leaves 94 kilometres to the finish line at Kanterava stadium. It was 5 am, and 506 kilometres done. My best time from Krishnagiri to Hosur was around 4 hours. During the last brevet, I had really pushed myself from Hosur to the finish line and it took me 2 hours (1 hr 45 mins to be precise). But today, I was definitely not in a condition to push myself. That meant it would at least take me 6 hours to the finish line which was an hour late.

Besides all of this, the thing which was running in my mind was the SR title which awaited me at the end (provided if I finish the brevet in time). Riding over 500 km, I was in no condition to allow this ride to go redundant. Else another 4-month wait to try and get the SR title, which is supposed to be the most difficult 600 BRM in India. I decided to give it all and try my best for the next 94 kilometres to be completed in 5 hours. I divided the entire distance into 2 sections; Krishnagiri to Hosur (50 km-3hrs) and Hosur to Finish line (44 km-2hrs).

It was a well-known route from here. I started to push myself as I needed to maintain at least an average of 16--17 km/hr over the first section. I had to skip breaks all together which were planned in this segment. Hunger started to kick in and I stuffed Multiple chikkis which I had taken from the last CP. Another cereal bar that Naga had given nearby the CP4 which I had completely forgotten(Thanks for that). That proved to be a lot helpful as it didn't need me to get me off the saddle. Soon I was at shoolagiri. I met Manju on the way. Took some 1--2 minute breaks, had 3 packets of cold flavoured milk from a small shop and started riding.

Finally reached Hosur around 7:45--8 am. This was a Personal Record for me on the Krishnagiri --- Hosur Segment (2:52:55) (strava stats :)) Still, Not a second to waste. I had 2 hours to reach the finish line. My water bottle was 1/2 full, so I didn't see a reason to stop and fill up water. My energy was completely drained, No food or energy bars with me and definitely no time to stop if I intend to complete the brevet on time. I got a message from Naga, that he quit the ride at Krishnagiri, as he was not able to ride with inadequate sleep. Felt quite bad, as he had a Late Finish to the 400 BRM due to a puncture near Hosur.

## The Last Miles

I started to ride ahead slowly. The sun started to hit. Putting on sunglasses were making me sleepy so had to switch back to normal specs. I was not able to take advantage of downhills to that extent. Even climbing small flyovers seemed a mighty huge task now and by the time I reached electronic city, my water bottle was empty. This was the first time I realized the use of having a 2nd bottle. Cursed myself for not having one, even though I had a spare bottle holder lying around back home. I did not want to take a break to fill up water as I was already running short on time.

It was around 09:15 am, another 45 mins to go. And a miracle happened, a group of 3 people who were casually cycling (Sorry I couldn't gather your names) helped me out by refilling my water bottle. I was pleasantly relieved as it took hardly a minute and my thirst was quenched.

## The Finish

I reached the finish line at 9:53 am, 7 mins before the cut off time. I would never forget this moment. The feeling of accomplishment and conquering the twin hills was truly out of bounds. I have no words to express this feeling. Mohan sir shook my hand and congratulated me on completing the ride and becoming an SR. Felt pretty good, had a smile stuck on my face which lasted till I reached home and slept on the floor without even removing my shoes off. It was one hell of a ride, which I'll remember all my days. Looking forward to many more such rides in the future :)
